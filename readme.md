This is a demonstrator for basic ORM functionality.

It utilizes Javascript, Handlebars, MYSQL, CSS, Express, and Node.

The application allows users to add burgers they wish to eat to a list, which is then stored in a SQL database. They may then indicate that they have eaten said burger by "devouring" it, which flips a tracking boolean in the database, and then renders the eaten burgers in a seperate frame. Handlebars handles all the HTML rendering in conjunction with CSS and Bootstrap, and Express, JS, and Node handle the backend. 

The app is stored in inactive form on github, and hosted live on Heroku.

Enjoy
